# Tokamak Sybil Resistance (SYB)
A sybil-resistant zk-rollup that scores Ethereum addresses based on a network of community vouches. Using off-chain computation and zk-proofs, the system ensures efficient, secure scoring to highlight genuine connections in decentralized networks.

The project consists of three components:
 
 ## Contracts
 holds the state root, verifies batch proofs from the sequencer, updates the root, and stores transaction data for availabilityâ€”while queuing essential L1 transactions for timely processing in the next batch. For more info, follow the [link](./contracts/README.md)

 ## Sequencer
 keeps track of the state as a Merkle tree, batches user transactions, and efficiently updates the network. For more info, setup, and running the sequencer follow the [link](./sequencer/README.md).

 ## Circuit
 defines the logic for applying transactions and updating the state tree, producing a proof from transaction data and state roots that the contract can verify to confirm valid state transitions. For more info, follow the [link](./circuits/README.md)
